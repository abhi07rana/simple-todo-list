# To-Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can enter a task in the input box and click the "ADD" button to add it to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Clicking on a task toggles its status between completed and incomplete.
- Remove tasks: Users can remove a task from the list by clicking the "Ã—" button next to it.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and works well on devices of all sizes.

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also deploy it to a live server to make it accessible online.

### Deploying to a Live Server

1. Choose a hosting provider for your website (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Firebase Hosting).
2. Upload the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files to your hosting provider.
3. Configure the server settings as needed.
4. Test your website to ensure everything is working correctly.
